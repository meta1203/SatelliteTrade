## Usage:

/trade <player> <value> - Opens the trade inventory for item input. Simply enter what you think the items you will put in this inventory are worth, add the items, and close the inventory. The trade request will be automatically sent to the other player.

/trade accept - Accepts a trade request sent to you. Funds will be withdraw, and the items will be deposited into your inventory. (Make sure you have enough inventory space!)

/trade deny - Deny's a trade request sent to you. All items will go back to the trade proposer, and no money will be exchanged.
